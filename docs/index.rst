   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Bricks's documentation!
==================================

Bricks is a Django application that helps you to sort heterogeneous models
applying a set of criteria.

Suppose for example that your site publishes news and videos and you need
to show them on a single page mixed together and sorted by one or more criteria.

Depending on how complex your models and your criteria are, it can get pretty
tricky.

The :doc:`usage` will guide you through a complete tutorial to explain the
concepts behind Bricks and to show how simple can be to achieve that goal.
